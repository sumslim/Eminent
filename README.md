We  will use the natural disaster place-wise past Data and using Data Analysis or Machine Learning we will predict the probability of natural calamity happening in that place and we will access different place location using geolocation API, if we want to make our app interactive. We will click on any natural calamity button then we will be able to get the probability of that particular natural disaster happening in that place. Using Data Analytics we can guess the magnitude of earthquake on Richter Scale. On magnitude basis we can even predict what damage it can cause to life etc.
